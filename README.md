# Serious-Games-Questionnaire

This questionnaire was designed in order to adress secondary education teachers in Greece and aimed to examine the use of serious games in the context of teaching, as well as teachersâ€™ attitudes toward them. It is a structured questionnaire developed to gather data on their awareness, attitudes, usage patterns, perceived benefits, and potential concerns, with a special attention given to the role of prior experience in shaping these perceptions.
